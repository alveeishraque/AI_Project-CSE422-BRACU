# || Lung Cancer Prediction Model ||

Focusing on developing a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of lung cancer based on various health-related and lifestyle features. The dataset used includes detailed information about 15 features:

Gender, Age, Smoking, Yellow Fingers, Anxiety, Peer Pressure, Chronic Disease, Fatigue, Allergy, Wheezing, Alcohol Consuming, Coughing, Shortness of Breath, Swallowing Difficulty, Chest Pain
The target variable in the dataset is Lung Cancer. The primary goal of this project is to create an accurate and efficient predictive tool that can assist in the early detection of lung cancer.

# Motivation
Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, making early detection critical for improving survival rates and optimizing treatment plans. This project leverages machine learning techniques to create a scalable and reliable model capable of analyzing complex patterns in health data. The ultimate objective is to facilitate early diagnosis and contribute to better health outcomes.

# Features
Predictive analytics for lung cancer risk.
Utilizes 15 detailed health and lifestyle features.
Designed to improve early detection rates.
Scalable and adaptable to various datasets.
